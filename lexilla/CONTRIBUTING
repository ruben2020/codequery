Lexilla is on GitHub at https://github.com/ScintillaOrg/lexilla

Bugs, fixes and features should be posted to the Issue Tracker
https://github.com/ScintillaOrg/lexilla/issues

Patches should include test cases. Add a test case file in 
lexilla/test/examples/<language> and run the test program in 
lexilla/test.
The result will be new files with ".styled.new" and ".folded.new"
appended containing lexing or folding results.
For lexing, there are brace surrounded style numbers for each style
start as markup:
{5}import{0} {11}contextlib{0}

For folding, there are 4 columns of folding results preceding the example text:
 2 400   0 + --[[ coding:UTF-8
 0 402   0 | comment ]]
See the test/README file for more explanation of the folding results.

To build lexilla and the tests with gcc there are Windows batch
and Unix shell files scripts/RunTest.bat scripts/RunTest.sh.
Check the result of the .new files and, if correct, rename replacing
".styled.new" with ".styled" and ".folded.new" with ".folded".
Run the tests again and success should be reported.
Include the .styled and .folded files in the patch.
Including test cases ensures that the change won't be undone by
other changes in the future and clarifies the intentions of the author.

Either send unified diffs (or patch files) or zip archives with whole files.
Mercurial/Git patch files are best as they include author information and commit
messages.

Lexilla is on GitHub so use its facilities rather than SourceForge which is
the home of Scintilla.
The neilh @ scintilla.org account receives much spam and is only checked
occasionally. Almost all Scintilla mail should go to the mailing list.
