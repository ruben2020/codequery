The test directory contains some unit and performance tests for Scintilla.

The tests can only be run on Windows using Python 2.7 or 3.x.
Python 2.7+ is required because the bytes string type and literals are available.
Scintilla must be built before running any tests.
Lexilla may be built before running tests but lexing tests will be skipped if Lexilla not available.

A test application for Windows only is in xite.py and this can be run to experiment:
pythonw xite.py

To run the basic tests:
python simpleTests.py

To check for performance regressions:
python performanceTests.py
While each test run will be different and the timer has only limited granularity, some results
from a 2 GHz Athlon with a DEBUG build are:
 0.187 testAddLine
. 0.203 testAddLineMiddle
. 0.171 testHuge
. 0.203 testHugeInserts
. 0.312 testHugeReplace
